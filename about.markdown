Hi! I'm Pranav Krishnan, a full-stack developer with a passion for software, video games, and generally all things tech. I love learning new things and taking on difficult challenges!

I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, and will graduate in April 2023. In the meantime, I'm always looking for something cool to build.

Want to work together? Shoot me an email at [pranav@pkrshnan.com](mailto:pranav@pkrshnan.com).
