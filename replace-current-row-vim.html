<h1>Clearing the Current Row in Vim</h1>
<p>Today I learned something really useful which started saving me a lot of time in vim. Up until recently, whenever I had to replace the content of the current row in a file, I had to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go into Normal Mode</li>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dd</code> to delete the current row’s contents</li>
  <li>Go to previous row, hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> followed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enter</code></li>
  <li>Start typing relevant content</li>
</ul>

<p>However, recently I realized that there is a default key-bind of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code>, which will clear the content of the current row and put you into insert mode at the correct indentation level. The workflow then becomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go into Normal Mode</li>
  <li>Hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S</code> to clear row’s contents and go into insert mode</li>
  <li>Start typing relevant content</li>
</ul>

<p>While this may seem like marginal improvements, it’s one less step which adds up over time. Hope this helped!</p>
